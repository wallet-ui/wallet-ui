description: The core library of Wallet UI
---

`@wallet-ui/core` is the framework-agnostic foundation of Wallet UI. It provides the necessary building blocks for state management and configuration that power the UI components and hooks in the React package.

This package is generally used as a peer dependency of `@wallet-ui/react` and you may not need to interact with it directly, but understanding its concepts is useful for advanced customization.

Explore the core concepts:

- [**Clusters**](./core/clusters): Learn how to configure the Solana clusters your app supports.
- [**Storage**](./core/storage): Understand how to manage and persist state.
- [**Utilities**](./core/utilities): Discover the available utility functions.
