The `@wallet-ui/css` package provides a pre-built CSS file with a default theme for the components. This is a great option if your project doesn't use Tailwind CSS.

### Installation

```package-install
npm install @wallet-ui/css
```

### Usage

You need to import the CSS file in your application.

```js
import '@wallet-ui/css/index.css';
```
