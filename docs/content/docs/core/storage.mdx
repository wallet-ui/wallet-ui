title: Storage
description: Persisting state in Wallet UI.
---

Wallet UI persists the user's selected wallet and cluster choice to `localStorage` so that their preferences are remembered across sessions. This is handled by `nanostores`, a tiny state manager.

The core library exports two functions to configure this persistence:

- `createStorageAccount()`: Manages the state for the selected wallet account.
- `createStorageCluster()`: Manages the state for the selected cluster.

By default, you don't need to call these functions. However, you can use them to customize the `localStorage` key used to store the data.

### Usage

```tsx
import { createWalletUiConfig, WalletUi } from '@wallet-ui/react';
import { createStorageAccount, createStorageCluster, createSolanaDevnet } from '@wallet-ui/core';

const config = createWalletUiConfig({
    clusters: [createSolanaDevnet()],
    accountStorage: createStorageAccount({ key: 'my-app-wallet-account' }),
    clusterStorage: createStorageCluster({ key: 'my-app-wallet-cluster' }),
});

function App({ children }) {
    return <WalletUi config={config}>{children}</WalletUi>;
}
```
