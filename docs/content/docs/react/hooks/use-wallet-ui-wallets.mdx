description: A hook to get a list of all detected wallets.
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `useWalletUiWallets` hook provides a list of all wallets that have been detected by the Wallet Standard.

<Callout>
    For most common use cases, consider using the main [`useWalletUi`](./use-wallet-ui) hook, which manages the
    currently selected wallet. This hook is for advanced use cases where you need to list all available wallets.
</Callout>

<Callout>
    This hook filters the wallets to only include those that support the Solana blockchain. It does so by checking if
    the wallet has a chain that starts with `solana:`.
</Callout>

### Usage

This hook is useful when you want to build a custom UI that lists all the available wallets.

```tsx
import { useWalletUiWallets } from '@wallet-ui/react';

function WalletList() {
    const wallets = useWalletUiWallets();

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Available Wallets:</h2>
            <ul>
                {wallets.map(wallet => (
                    <li key={wallet.name}>{wallet.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Return Value

The hook returns an array of `UiWallet` objects.

```ts
export type UiWallet = Readonly<Wallet>;
```

The `Wallet` interface is defined by the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard).
