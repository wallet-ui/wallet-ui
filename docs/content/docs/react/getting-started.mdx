## Get started with a template

The easiest way to get started is to use a template. It comes with everything you need to get started.

### Next.js and Tailwind CSS

Basic Next.js app with Tailwind, gill and Wallet UI.

Use templates `gill-next-tailwind-basic` or `gill-next-tailwind-counter` to generate Anchor examples.

```package-install
npx create-solana-dapp@latest -t gill-next-tailwind
```

### React with Vite and Tailwind CSS
